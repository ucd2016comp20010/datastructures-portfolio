# Data Structures Portfolio - datastructures-thomasreilly1011
A collection of data structures designed and implemented in Java as part of my UCD Computer Science, Data Structures class.
Included is an array of popular data structures ranging from simple lists, queues and stacks to hashmaps and binary search trees.
Additionally, there are algorithms that make use of the included data structures to efficiently process tasks. Each of the 
concrete data structures in the repository include.

## Getting started & Pre Requisites
To compile or run any of the files in this repository you will need a Java SDK and JRE of 8 or above. To run the JUnit tests, 
you will need to include the JUnit4/ JUnit5.4 library.

To view or test any of the included data structures I would suggest cloning the repository into a project in your favourite IDE.
Each of the concrete classes come with a main function that demonstrate the behaviour of the data structure.
The included JUnit tests, however, perform a more rigorous testing of each of the methods of the data structures ADT.

* Lists
    * SinglyLinkedList
